## Kaggle Dataset
Kaggle [provides](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) a dataset containing the meta-data of all arXiv papers. This dataset can be downloaded on Kaggle or using Google Buckets (this may be useful for some sort of automatization in the future).

The dataset consists of JSON objects that contain information about the papers. Of interest to this project are:
 * title
 * id
 * versions
 * categories
 
 Out of the many millions of articles, there are around 800.000 that have more than one version.
